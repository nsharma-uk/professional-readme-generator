## Project Description
This project uses node.js to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input.

The user is asked series of prompt questions in the terminal about the information of their project.

After the user's submited responses, a markdown file will be dynamically generated and will include a bulleted table of contents (with navigation links), installation instructions, license type selected from a list as well as an email address and github information.
